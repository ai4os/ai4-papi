"""
Authentication for private methods of the API (mainly managing deployments)

Implementation notes:
====================
Authentication is implemented using `get_user_infos_from_access_token` instead
of `get_user_infos_from_request` (as done in the FastAPI example in the flaat docs).
There are two advantages of this:
* the main one is that it would enable us enable to take advantage of Swagger's builtin
  Authentication and Authorization [1] in the Swagger interface (generated by FastAPI).
  This is not possible using the `Request` object, as data from `Request` cannot be validated and
  documented by OpenAPI [2].

  [1] https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/
  [2] https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/using-request-directly/?h=request#details-about-the-request-object

* the decorator `flaat.is_authenticated()` around each function is no longer needed,
  as authentication is checked automatically by `authorization=Depends(security)` without needing extra code.

The curl calls still remain the same, but now in the http://localhost/docs you will see an authorize
 button where you can copy paste your token. So you will be able to access authenticated methods from the interface.
