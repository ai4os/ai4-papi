# User customizable configuration to make a deployment in Nomad.
# Additional non-customizable values (eg. ports) are hardcoded in `job.nomad`.

# All conf parameters follow the same structure:
# varname:
#  name: name of the parameter to be displayed to end user (mandatory)
#  value: (default) value of the parameter (mandatory)
#  options: restricted set of values that the parameter can take (optional)
#  description: some comments on the parameter to be displayed to the end user (optional)

general:
  title:
    name: Deployment title
    value: ''
    description: Provide short title for this deployment (less than 45 characters). Useful when you have lots of different active deployments.

  desc:
    name: Deployment description
    value: ''
    description: Provide some additional extended information about this deployment.

  hostname:
    name: Hostname
    value: ''
    description: Host where your application will be deployed. Selecting `myapp` will make your deployment accessible at `http://myapp.deployments.etc`). If not provided, hostname will automatically default to your `job-uuid`.

  docker_image:
    name: Docker image
    value: 'ai4oshub/ai4os-federated-server'

  docker_tag:
    name: Docker tag
    value: 'latest'
    description: Docker tag to use. Tags are module dependent. You should choose the appropriate tag for your selected hardware (eg. use a `gpu`-like tag if you plan to run on GPUs).
    options: ['latest']

  service:
    name: Service to run
    value: 'fedserver'
    description: When selecting FedServer, you won't be able to use JupyterLab/VScode, and vice versa. If you want to have access to both services at the same time, your best option is to deploy with JupyterLab/VScode. Then, open a terminal window and run FedServer yourself by typing `cd federated-server/fedserver` and then `python3 server.py`. You can also modify `server.py` different federation options than the ones initially selected at creation time.
    options: ['fedserver', 'jupyter', 'vscode']
