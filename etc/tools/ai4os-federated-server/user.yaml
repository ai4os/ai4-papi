# User customizable configuration to make a deployment in Nomad.
# Additional non-customizable values (eg. ports) are hardcoded in `job.nomad`.

# All conf parameters follow the same structure:
# varname:
#  name: name of the parameter to be displayed to end user (mandatory)
#  value: (default) value of the parameter (mandatory)
#  options: restricted set of values that the parameter can take (optional)
#  description: some comments on the parameter to be displayed to the end user (optional)

    value: 'fedserver'
    description: When selecting FedServer, you won't be able to use JupyterLab/VScode, and vice versa. If you want to have access to both services at the same time, your best option is to deploy with JupyterLab/VScode. Then, open a terminal window and run FedServer yourself by typing `cd federated-server/fedserver` and then `python3 server.py`. You can also modify `server.py` different federation options than the ones initially selected at creation time.
    options: ['fedserver', 'jupyter', 'vscode']
