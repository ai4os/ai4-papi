# User customizable configuration to make a deployment in Nomad.
# Additional non-customizable values (eg. ports) are hardcoded in `job.nomad`.

# All conf parameters follow the same structure:
# varname:
#  name: name of the parameter to be displayed to end user (mandatory)
#  value: (default) value of the parameter (mandatory)
#  options: restricted set of values that the parameter can take (optional)
#  description: some comments on the parameter to be displayed to the end user (optional)

# CPU/RAM limits are based on the current have GPU flavours we (IFCA) have deployed:
# * g13-gpuib-8-86:
#     - 8 GPUs Nvidia Tesla T4
#     - 86 VCPUs --> ~9.6 cores / gpu (reserving 10% for the node)
#     - 351 GB RAM --> ~40 GB / gpu (reserving 10% for the node)
# * g12-gpuib-2-64:
#     - 2 GPUs Nvidia Tesla V100
#     - 64 VCPUs --> ~28 cores / gpu (reserving 10% for the node)
#     - 127 GB RAM --> ~57 GB / gpu (reserving 10% for the node)
